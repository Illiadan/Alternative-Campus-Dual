## Get started
1. Install `python python-virtualenv python-pip` (package names come from Arch Linux; Python 3.9 required).
2. Clone this git repository.
3. Create and activate an python virtual environment.
4. Run `pip install -r src/requirements.txt` to install dependencies.
5. Edit `src/campusdual/settings.py` to change settings like database, email delivery or security. No changes needed if you are developing.
6. Run `python src/manage.py migrate` to setup database scheme.
7. Run `python src/manage.py createsuperuser` to create an admin account for logging in.
8. Run `python src/manage.py runserver` to start the django server (only for development!).

## Warning
Django-explorer requires an unix directory at `/mnt/info` otherwise the server wont start / crash, so developing that portion of code can only be done on a unix system. To start developing the other components on Windows, locally-delete the directory `src/django-explorer`, comment out the corresponding path in `src/campusdual/urls.py` and remove the app in `src/campusdual/settings.py`.  

The app was developed using the web browsers Chrome/Chromium and Firefox, so the app may not work or look odd in other/older web browsers.
